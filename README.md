## Log

### Day1 
I joined CodeWars community. Very happy about that. Small challenge in Java to break the ice.
I decided to solve another 2 challenges in Java, one of them with strings. I discovered some built-in methods for strings similiar to those from C/C++. Managed to solve both challenges. :)

### Day2
Started the OOP challenge from Tim's course. I find it difficult to understand in first instance. I will try :soon: to do it again. Hope to have more success. OOP is very useful and very interesting.
I recieved my new Asus machine which is very :cool:.

### Day3
Finally I had the first contact with arrays in Java. ðŸ˜ƒ
Completed a CodeWars challenge with arrays - sum of array's elements. String are on their way, too.

### Day4
Completed 2 lessons from Tim's course. Step by step I get used to Java arrays' style (I still declare them like in C/C++ ðŸ˜†).
I got rid of Endless from my Asus machine and managed to install Windows10 and IntelliJ.

### Day5
Had a hard day due to some home renovations. ðŸ”§ Hopefully, I didn't missed the day and completed another string exercise.
First project on the new machine. I really like to code late in the night. :owl:

### Day6
Solved two more challenges from Tim's course - minimum of an array and reverse of an array. Easy-peasy.
Now I'm able to declare arrays without consulting my notes. ðŸ“š
Started to write this journal to have a situation of my progress. ðŸ“ˆ
